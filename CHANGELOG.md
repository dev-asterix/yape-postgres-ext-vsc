## [0.7.5] - 2026-01-05

### Architecture Refactoring (Phase 3 Complete)
- **Hybrid Connection Pooling**: Implemented a smart pooling strategy using `pg.Pool` for ephemeral operations and `pg.Client` for session-based tasks.
- **Service Layer**: Introduced a robust service layer architecture:
    - `QueryHistoryService`: Centralized management of query history with persistence.
    - `ErrorService`: Standardized error handling and reporting across the extension.
    - `SecretStorageService`: Secure management of credentials using VS Code's SecretStorage API.
- **Modular Codebase**: Split monolithic files (`extension.ts`, `renderer_v2.ts`) into focused modules (`commands/`, `providers/`, `services/`) for better maintainability.

### Added
- **SQL Parsing Engine**: Integrated a sophisticated SQL parser to enable advanced query analysis and safety checks.
- **Schema Caching**: Implemented intelligent caching for database schemas to improve autocomplete and tree view performance.

### Improved
- **Performance**: Enforced a **10k row limit** on backend results to prevent memory crashes on large queries.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Frontend now handles large datasets using a virtualized list with intersection observers (200 rows/chunk).
- **Type Safety**: Removed `any` types from core services, enforcing strict TypeScript definitions.
